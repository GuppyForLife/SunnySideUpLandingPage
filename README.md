## My process

I started with the images and tools given to me. It begin with a non designed HTML page with just words for content, not formatted whatsoever. I started from the top down, section by section and didnt move on until that element looked good in my web browser. Throughout the challenge I referred to CSS documentations, Bootstrap documentation, and a couple YouTube videos for various things. Once I completed each step, I made sure to make a commit to git and GitHub remote repo. Additionally, before moving on from each section, I made sure it was responsive and mobile friendly. Once everything looked good, I focused on the finer details such as making a responsive mobile menu and fixing margins, padding, and spacing for various device sizes

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap


### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to implement my knowledge of React.js and maybe even make a React Native version of this same project. I'd also like to start using Sass for my CSS styles. Additionally, I'd like to make a full stack website out of these projects once I finish up learning about Node.js and Express.
